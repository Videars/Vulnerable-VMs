# Vulnerable-VMs
This is a collection of some virtual machines that I have created and attacked.

* In [/HackTheBox](/HackTheBox) you will find some short writeups of 4 htb machines I have exploited. This is my [htb profile](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1423018) for more details.
* [VM-creation.pdf](VM-creation.pdf) is a walkthrough of an Ubuntu vulnerable server creation. The server contains multiple remote and local vulnerabilities. The remote vulnerabilities implemented
were both web based and service based. The local vulnerabilities implemented were misconfigurations of critical files’ permissions and services’ known exploits. [This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t-RXIK0_CXOSlfyCTCEHjUQDSH6_qMRJ/view?usp=sharing) is the Google Drive link to the machine's OVA file if you want to try to attack the server.
* [Server-attack.pdf](Server-attack.pdf) is a walkthrough of an Ubuntu vulnerable server attack. The report contains all the main activities executed against the server to identify and exploit the vulnerabilities. At the end of the report you can even find the cleaning traces and persistency phases.
